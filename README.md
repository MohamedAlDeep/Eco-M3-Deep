# Eco M3 Deep
It is my custom built 3D printer, with all custom 3D printed parts with large bed area.

I made this printer as it would help in making other projects as i don't have direct access to one, and i am interested more on hackclub events projects & science projects which constantly need custom 3D printed parts.

## Features 
    - Simplicity
    - Large Bed size with area of 40cmx40cm
    - Remote Extruder
    - The structure & large bed mount are made from wood to reduce cost
    - Expandable design for future additions

## Assembly
1. Mounts 

    - It is simple, start by putting linear bearings into the mounts specifically the moving z axis and the hotend mounts. 
2. Attachments
    -  Screw the hotend
    - Attach mechanical stops with the y axis motor, the same applies to the z axis bottom mount.
    - Screw the x axis bed motor onto its place.
    - Add the pulleys onto the motors shafts and onto a 3D printed small 8mm shaft that is connected to a 8mm bearing.
3. Structure
    - Make 7x 2x3cm wooden part with length of 50cm, put them together as in the image.
4. Axes assembly
    - Z axis
        - Connect the bottom z axis motor to the coupler and the coupler to the T8 lead screw.
        - Connect the T8 screw nut onto its place on the movable z axis middle mount.
        - Connect the upper z mount that has an 8mm bearing into the T8 screw.
        - Stabalize the structure by connecting the linear rod into its place through the three mounts.
        - The same applies on the other side
    - X axis
        - Mount the motors
        - Place the linear rods into their mounts 
        - Put the linear bearings into thier movable mounts.
        - Screw the movable mounts onto a 45x45cm wooden bed.
    - Y axis
        - Mount the hotend into its place
        - Connect the linear bearings
        - Screw the hotend mount onto the movable part.
