# Eco M3 Deep
It is my custom built 3D printer, with all custom 3D printed parts with large bed area.

I made this printer as it would help in making other projects as i don't have direct access to one, and i am interested more on hackclub events projects & science projects which constantly need custom 3D printed parts.
